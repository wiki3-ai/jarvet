## O*NET graph data

The O*NET N-Triples graph database is downloaded from the
[O*NET Resource Center](https://www.onetcenter.org/database.html#graph) during
devcontainer setup. The extracted database is intentionally excluded from Git.

To initialize or restore it manually, run:

```bash
./scripts/init-onet-data.sh
```

The script defaults to O*NET 31.0. Set `ONET_VERSION` using underscores to
download another published version, for example `ONET_VERSION=30_2`.
